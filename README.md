# AbletechSolution

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.3.21.

## Development server

After git clone, you should run 'npm install'.

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. Or you can also run : 'ng serve --open' 
The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

Well done : you can now creat a new account or sign in with test@test.test / test@test98
